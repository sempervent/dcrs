Decentralized Content Reward System

The Decentralized Content Reward System is designed to rewart content creators, content hosters, 
and certain members of the system that contribute to the system. The system is designed to be
decentralized and to be able to run on a blockchain. The idea behind the system is that ad space
or sponsored content will not appear. Users can have a variety of algorithms they can choose from
or they could use a playlist of algorithms to determine how to have content served to them.

Algorithms themselves are registered on the blockchain and are able to be used by anyone, but the
same roles per view or direct access prevail. The application is designed to be deployed anywhere,
with an optional storage. The storage is designed to actually store the content created and 
registered on the blockchain.

Essentially, the process is this:

1. A user logs into the system and configures their wallet and posts unique content.
2. That content goes through our algorithm to a content reviewr
3. the content reviewer reviews the content to mark it appropriate, some simple content can be automated
4. the content is then hashed and stored in the blockchain and then stored in a storage file storage hosting
5. the application in an instance when the storage option was chosen.
6. now that it is available on the blockchain, participating sites can pick up ledger and identify new content, retrieve thumbnail (or title) and display it in other instances
7. that user leaves and another user logs on
8. new user sees first users' post and engages with it by commenting a thoughtful review and has chosen to register this content
9. this causes the coin to be created upon the validated engagement
10. This coin is distributed to the content creator, the content hoster, and the content reviewer
11. a new user logs in and sees the content
12. this user shares the comment and the content
13. now tens of users have viewed this content and engaged with it
14. that resulted in 11 coins being generated for the original content and 10 coins for the comment.
15. the original content creator does not owe the commentor, but the original content creator would receive 10% of the comment's coins

To keep the system fair and honest, there will never be advertising or sponsored products within this system.

## Weaknesses
- Complexity - blockchain technology and coin-based rewards system may be difficult for some users to understand
- Learning Curve - users may need time to familiarize themselves with the platform and its features
- Technical complexity - decentralized networking, blockchain synchonization, and storage challenges
- User Adoption - may take time for users to adopt the platform and understand its benefits
- The need for 3 content reviewers to sign off on content may slow down the system
- Content storage may be expensive, especially for large files or high-resolution media
- Limited content moderation - automated content review may not catch all inappropriate content
- Limited content discovery - users may have difficulty finding new and interesting content
- Limited content sharing - users may not be incentivized to share content with others
- Limited content creation - users may not be motivated to create new content
- Limited content engagement - users may not be incentivized to engage with content
- Limited content monetization - users may not be able to earn rewards for their content
- Limited content hosting - users may not be able to store and share their content
- Limited content distribution - users may not be able to reach a wide audience
- Limited content curation - users may not be able to discover high-quality content
- Limited content feedback - users may not be able to provide feedback on content
- Limited content interaction - users may not be able to interact with content creators

## Opportunities
- Growth - potential for rapid growth and widespread adoption of the platform
- Innovation - opportunity to develop new features, algorithms, and content types
- Monetization - opportunity to earn rewards for creating, sharing, and engaging with content
- Collaboration - opportunity to collaborate with other developers, content creators, and users
- Community - opportunity to build a strong, engaged community of users and contributors
- Engagement - opportunity to increase user engagement, retention, and loyalty
- Expansion - opportunity to expand into new markets, industries, and use cases
- Strategic Partnerships - opportunity to form partnerships with other companies, organizations, and platforms

## Threats
- Competition - potential competition from other decentralized content platforms, social networks, and media companies
- Regulation - potential regulatory challenges, legal issues, and compliance requirements
- Content Moderation - potential issues with inappropriate, offensive, or harmful content
- Data Privacy - potential concerns about data collection, tracking, and user privacy
- Security - potential risks of hacking, fraud, data breaches, and other security threats
- Scalability - potential challenges with scaling the platform, handling increased traffic, and growing the user base
- 51% Attack - potential risk of a 51% attack on the blockchain, compromising security and integrity
- Centralization - potential risk of centralization, control, and censorship of content and transactions
- Network Congestion - potential issues with network congestion, slow transactions, and high fees
- User Experience - potential issues with usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction
- Content Quality - potential issues with low-quality, spammy, or irrelevant content
- Content Discovery - potential issues with content discovery, search, and recommendation algorithms
- Content Sharing - potential issues with content sharing, distribution, and virality
- Content Creation - potential issues with content creation tools, features, and incentives

# Poking Holes in the Theory
- Scalability Concerns:

   - Can the platform scale effectively with increasing user numbers without compromising performance, especially in a decentralized network?
   - How will the platform handle a high volume of transactions, particularly with the coin-based reward system and voting mechanism?

- User Experience:

    - Is the user experience intuitive enough for users unfamiliar with blockchain or cryptocurrencies?
    - Will the requirement for three reviewers slow down content approval, leading to user dissatisfaction?

- Content Moderation:

    - Can the AI moderation effectively handle the complexity of content types without human oversight?
    - How will the platform manage disputes or appeals against content moderation decisions?

- Adoption Challenges:

    - How will you attract the initial user base? What incentives are strong enough to pull users away from established platforms?
    - Will the learning curve for blockchain-based interactions (e.g., managing wallets, understanding coins) deter potential users?
