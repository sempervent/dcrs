Decentralized Content Reward System

The Decentralized Content Reward System is designed to rewart content creators, content hosters, 
and certain members of the system that contribute to the system. The system is designed to be
decentralized and to be able to run on a blockchain. The idea behind the system is that ad space
or sponsored content will not appear. Users can have a variety of algorithms they can choose from
or they could use a playlist of algorithms to determine how to have content served to them.

Algorithms themselves are registered on the blockchain and are able to be used by anyone, but the
same roles per view or direct access prevail. The application is designed to be deployed anywhere,
with an optional storage. The storage is designed to actually store the content created and 
registered on the blockchain.

Essentially, the process is this:

1. A user logs into the system and configures their wallet and posts unique content.
2. That content goes through our algorithm to a content reviewr
3. the content reviewer reviews the content to mark it appropriate, some simple content can be automated
4. the content is then hashed and stored in the blockchain and then stored in a storage file storage hosting
5. the application in an instance when the storage option was chosen.
6. now that it is available on the blockchain, participating sites can pick up ledger and identify new content, retrieve thumbnail (or title) and display it in other instances
7. that user leaves and another user logs on
8. new user sees first users' post and engages with it by commenting a thoughtful review and has chosen to register this content
9. this causes the coin to be created upon the validated engagement
10. This coin is distributed to the content creator, the content hoster, and the content reviewer
11. a new user logs in and sees the content
12. this user shares the comment and the content
13. now tens of users have viewed this content and engaged with it
14. that resulted in 11 coins being generated for the original content and 10 coins for the comment.
15. the original content creator does not owe the commentor, but the original content creator would receive 10% of the comment's coins

To keep the system fair and honest, there will never be advertising or sponsored products within this system.
